Assignment:
● Download & open this CSV file. The CSV file has two columns: charge_point_id and payload. Each row represents a “meter value record”.
● Make a Websocket server. This server is to be beamed up with the data above, coming from more than 50,000 clients at a single point in time. The data will continue to stream iteratively for 1 hours in a repeated manner.
● You’ll have to make mock clients (use
https: https://www.artillery.io/) that pick up the individual meter value records from the given CSV file and send it to the Websocket server that you created in an interval of 5 seconds. You can consider each charge_point_id as a client and send only the meter value records of that client/charge point.
● The data received by the server should be stored in a DB (SQL or NoSQL, it’s up to you).
● This stored data should be retrievable by 1000 external parties via 2 API endpoints (use
https: https://www.artillery.io/ to mock up the external parties as well).
○ List endpoint: this API endpoint should be able to return the data in a paginated format and if requested only for certain charge point ids that are passed in the request.
○ Detail endpoint: this API endpoint should be able to return the complete data for a single record.
○ Use 200OK as the validator for a successful request response cycle
○ Make sure each request response occurs under 200ms (P50th percentile)
